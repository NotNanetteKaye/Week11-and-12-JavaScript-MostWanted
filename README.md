"JavaScript is a scripting language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. Every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third and final piece of the Front End, after HTML and CSS."
