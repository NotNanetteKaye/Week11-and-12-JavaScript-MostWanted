\- Key Concepts: JavaScript & Introduction to React.js

"JavaScript is a scripting language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. Every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third and final piece of the Front End, after HTML and CSS."  

Now that you have some JavaScript under your belt, it's time to dive into how we can access and manipulate arrays (collections) of simple or complex data! We'll be covering callbacks (functions as parameters), JavaScript object literals, and the higher-order array methods ( .map()  and .filter() ). After you feel comfortable with those three, move onto recursion (how a function can call itself to reach a solution).  


This is it! The tip of the spear when it comes to Frontend JavaScript development -- Facebook's React.js library!

The lectures will introduce you to stronger, leaner ways to write your functions (Arrow Functions) as well as a brief overview of how React helps us write declarative JavaScript vs. imperative JavaScript.

Once you've reviewed those videos, it's time to code along with our instructor-led demo series. We'll be installing Node.js (server-side JavaScript) in order to run our React applications, discussing project setup procedures, and finally building our first user interface with React!
